**GamedevelopmentCore: A Rust-based Framework for Building High-Performance Games**
===============================================================================

GamedevelopmentCore is a comprehensive, open-source framework designed to simplify the process of building high-performance, cross-platform games using Rust. This framework provides a robust set of tools, libraries, and abstractions to help game developers focus on creating engaging game logic, rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

The primary goal of GamedevelopmentCore is to provide a unified, modular architecture that enables developers to build high-quality games with ease. By leveraging Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency features, this framework enables developers to create games that are not only fast and efficient but also scalable and maintainable. GamedevelopmentCore is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to tailor the framework to their specific needs and requirements.

One of the key benefits of using GamedevelopmentCore is its ability to abstract away low-level game development complexities, such as graphics rendering, input handling, and audio management. This enables developers to focus on creating game logic, AI, and physics, while the framework takes care of the underlying implementation details. Additionally, GamedevelopmentCore provides a robust set of tools and libraries for debugging, testing, and profiling, making it easier to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

**Key Features**

* **Modular Architecture**: GamedevelopmentCore is designed with a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily swap out or replace individual components as needed.
* **Rust-based**: Built on top of Rust, GamedevelopmentCore leverages the language's performance, safety, and concurrency features to provide a robust and efficient game development framework.
* **Cross-Platform Support**: GamedevelopmentCore provides out-of-the-box support for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* **Graphics Abstraction**: The framework provides a high-level graphics abstraction layer, making it easy to switch between different graphics APIs, such as Vulkan, Metal, or OpenGL.
* **Input Handling**: GamedevelopmentCore includes a robust input handling system, supporting multiple input devices, including keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepads.
* **Audio Management**: The framework provides a comprehensive audio management system, supporting multiple audio formats and APIs.
* **Debugging and Profiling Tools**: GamedevelopmentCore includes a set of built-in debugging and profiling tools, making it easier to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

**Technology Stack**

* **Rust**: The primary programming language used for building GamedevelopmentCore.
* **Vulkan**: A cross-platform, open-standard graphics API used for rendering graphics.
* **SDL**: A cross-platform library used for input handling, audio management, and graphics rendering.
* **Rust-SDL2**: A Rust wrapper around the SDL library, providing a safe and efficient interface for interacting with SDL.
* **failure**: A Rust error handling library used for robust error handling and reporting.

**Installation**

To install GamedevelopmentCore, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust by following the official Rust installation instructions.
2. Clone the GamedevelopmentCore repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/GamedevelopmentCore.git`.
3. Change into the repository directory using the command `cd GamedevelopmentCore`.
4. Run the command `cargo build` to build the GamedevelopmentCore framework.
5. Run the command `cargo run` to start the GamedevelopmentCore example game.

**Configuration**

To configure GamedevelopmentCore, set the following environment variables:

* `GAMEDVELOPMENT_CORE_GRAPHICS_API`: Specifies the graphics API to use (e.g., Vulkan, Metal, or OpenGL).
* `GAMEDVELOPMENT_CORE_INPUT_DEVICE`: Specifies the input device to use (e.g., keyboard, mouse, or gamepad).

**Usage**

To use GamedevelopmentCore, create a new Rust project and add the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:

Then, import the GamedevelopmentCore framework in your Rust file:

Create a new instance of the `Game` struct, passing in the desired graphics API and input device:

Finally, run the game loop using the `run` method:
